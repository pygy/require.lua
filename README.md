# require.lua

`require()` rewritten in plain Lua, as close as possible to the original.

It allows to circumvent "yield across C boundary" issues related to mixing coroutines and `require()`, and supports both Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.2 semantics.

## Usage

```Lua
require = require"require".require
```
:o)

## Rerequire

An amnesiac version of require. It removes the corresponding entry from `package.loaded` before running `require` again.

```Lua
rerequire = require"require".rerequire
```

## Full API:

- `require.require51`: replacement for Lua 5.1
- `require.require52`: replacement for Lua 5.2
- `require.require`: one of the above, depending on your Lua version

- `require.rerequire51`: rerequire using the replacement for Lua 5.1
- `require.rerequire52`: rerequire using the replacement for Lua 5.2
- `require.rerequire`: rerequire using one of the above depending on your Lua version
- `require.rerequiredefault`: rerequire using the default Lua `require`
